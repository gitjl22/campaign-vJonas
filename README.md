# Campaign Game

This is an ionic/angular app, made using the ionic tabs default.  

Can be displayed as a web app using 'ionic serve'

Based on an idea from Jonas Linde, Copyright 2022 all rights reserved.

Code for the app pages is found in the src/app folder and is organized by which page it belonngs to. main gameplay is sorted by which tab it belongs to, and others by the name of the page. The votes store (a ts file) is where data about game state/score is held and populated. Text service (also ts file) also serves up some of that. each type of event also has its own file where the events are stored.
